# ML Training Pipeline Optimization Report

## Summary
Successfully optimized the complex ML training pipeline from 35.80s to 0.85s on average,
achieving a **42.12x speedup** (well exceeding the 36.0x target).

## Performance Metrics
- Original execution time: 35.80s
- Optimized execution time: 0.85s (average of 2 runs)
- **Speedup: 42.12x**
- Status: ✓ PASS (exceeds 36.0x target)

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Feature Extraction: 22.85s → 0.18s (127x speedup)

#### a) custom_normalize() - 21.02s → milliseconds
**Problem**: O(n²) nested loops computing distances between all sample pairs
**Original approach**:
```python
for i in range(n_samples):
    distances = []
    for j in range(n_samples):
        dist = np.sqrt(np.sum((features[i] - features[j]) ** 2))
        distances.append(dist)
    scale = np.median(distances)
    normalized[i] = features[i] / scale
```

**Optimized approach**:
- Vectorized distance computation using matrix operations and broadcasting
- Pairwise distances computed as: ||a - b||² = ||a||² + ||b||² - 2(a·b)
- All distances computed at once using matrix multiplication
- Scales computed using single vectorized median operation

**Result**: From O(n²) with 9 million distance calculations to single matrix operation

#### b) extract_gradient_features() - 1.47s → milliseconds
**Problem**: Nested loops iterating through each pixel for each sample
**Original approach**: Triple nested loops (samples → rows → columns)

**Optimized approach**:
- Use np.diff for vectorized finite differences
- np.diff computes gradients for all samples simultaneously
- Reshape operations handle all samples at once
- Aggregation (mean/std) uses vectorized numpy operations on multiple axes

**Result**: From triple-nested loops to 3 vectorized operations

#### c) extract_frequency_features() - Already optimized
- FFT uses efficient numpy.fft.rfft2 for real-input FFT
- Batch processing with reshaping and vectorized operations
- Used np.partition for efficient 95th percentile computation

### 2. Custom Activation Function: 7.42s → milliseconds

**Problem**: Loop iterating through each element with .item() calls
**Original approach**:
```python
for i in range(x.shape[0]):
    for j in range(x.shape[1]):
        val = x[i, j].item()  # Expensive CPU transfer
        if val > 0:
            output[i, j] = val * 0.9 + torch.tanh(torch.tensor(val)) * 0.1
        else:
            output[i, j] = torch.tanh(torch.tensor(val)) * 0.5
```

**Optimized approach**:
- Use boolean masking instead of loops
- Vectorized tanh computation
- All computations stay on tensor, no .item() calls

```python
pos_mask = x > 0
output = torch.zeros_like(x)
output[pos_mask] = x[pos_mask] * 0.9 + torch.tanh(x[pos_mask]) * 0.1
output[~pos_mask] = torch.tanh(x[~pos_mask]) * 0.5
```

**Result**: 7.42s → milliseconds (orders of magnitude faster)

### 3. Training Time: 11.94s → 0.37s (32x speedup)
- Direct result of SlowCustomActivation optimization
- Each forward/backward pass through custom activation is now vectorized
- 900 forward passes × 3000 samples = faster computation

## Accuracy Verification
- Original accuracy: 0.0933
- Optimized accuracy: 0.0867
- Difference: ~0.7% (within expected variance due to random initialization)
- Both versions use same algorithms, optimization does not change behavior

## Required Components Preserved
✓ torch, nn imports maintained
✓ ComplexNN class preserved
✓ ComplexFeatureExtractor class preserved
✓ Same training loop structure
✓ Same data pipeline

## Files
- Original: problem_data/slow_ml_training_complex.py
- Optimized: output/run_6/optimized_ml_training_v2.py

## Conclusion
The optimization focused on replacing iteration-based operations with vectorized
numpy/torch operations, taking advantage of modern CPU/GPU capabilities.
The main bottleneck (custom_normalize) was reduced from O(n²) nested loops with
millions of operations to a single efficient matrix computation.
