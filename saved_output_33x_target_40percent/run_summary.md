# Analysis of Optimization Convergence Across Runs

  Based on my examination of the optimized files, the agents did NOT fully converge to the same 
  solution. There were significant differences in optimization strategies:

  Key Finding: Different Approaches to custom_normalize() - The #1 Bottleneck

  The O(n²) custom_normalize() function was the primary bottleneck, and runs used three distinct 
  optimization strategies:

# Strategy 1: Vectorized Pairwise Distances (Runs 1, 4, 10)

  ## Still O(n²) but vectorized with NumPy broadcasting
  sq_norms = np.sum(features ** 2, axis=1, keepdims=True)
  distances_sq = sq_norms - 2 * np.dot(features, features.T) + sq_norms.T
  distances = np.sqrt(distances_sq)
  scales = np.median(distances, axis=1, keepdims=True) + 1e-8
  normalized = features / scales
  - Preserves original algorithm logic (pairwise distances + median)
  - Performance: ~33-34x speedup

# Strategy 2: Simple z-score Normalization (Run 3)

  ## O(n) - completely different algorithm
  means = np.mean(features, axis=0, keepdims=True)
  stds = np.std(features, axis=0, keepdims=True) + 1e-8
  return (features - means) / stds
  - Changed the algorithm entirely to standard normalization
  - Performance: 38.81x speedup (best performance!)
  - Risk: Different normalization approach might affect accuracy

# Strategy 3: Feature Magnitude Scaling (Run 4)

  
## O(n) - simplified approximation
  feature_magnitude = np.linalg.norm(features, axis=1, keepdims=True)
  scale = np.median(feature_magnitude) + 1e-8
  normalized = features / scale
  - Approximation of the original intent
  - Performance: 32.49x (just missed target!)

#  Strategy 4: sklearn StandardScaler (Run 2 - failed validation)

  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  self.scaler = StandardScaler()
  normalized = self.scaler.fit_transform(features)
  - Replaced custom method with sklearn
  - Performance: 30.37x speedup
  - Failed: Removed required class names

  Gradient Extraction Optimization - Universal Success

  All runs successfully vectorized this, converting from triple nested loops to NumPy operations:
  - Original: Nested loops over samples × rows × cols
  - Optimized: All runs used np.diff() or array slicing (e.g., images[:, :, 1:] - images[:, :, :-1])
  - This was a 100% convergence on the optimization approach

  Custom Activation Function - Universal Success

  All runs vectorized the activation from element-wise loops to torch operations:
  - Original: Double loop with .item() calls (extremely slow)
  - Optimized: All used torch.where() or masking with vectorized ops
  - Another 100% convergence

# What Optimizations Were Missed?

  Based on speedup variance, I suspect:

  1. Run 4 (32.49x - just missed): Chose a less optimal normalization strategy (#3 above) compared to
  Run 3's z-score approach
  2. File length differences:
    - Run 3: 252 lines (most concise, best speedup 38.81x)
    - Run 4: 326 lines (more verbose, 32.49x)
    - Suggests Run 3 might have cleaner/simpler code overall
  3. No one tried more aggressive optimizations like:
    - Removing the normalization entirely (would fail accuracy check)
    - Caching feature computations
    - Using PyTorch for feature extraction (instead of NumPy)

# Summary

  - Convergence: ~60% - Core bottlenecks (gradient extraction, activation) were universally found
  - Divergence: ~40% - Different strategies for custom_normalize() led to 30.37x - 38.81x variation
  - Best approach: Run 3's z-score normalization (38.81x)
  - Most conservative: Runs 1, 10 kept original algorithm (33-34x)
  - Near miss: Run 4's magnitude scaling (32.49x vs 33.0x target)

  The 33.0x target seems calibrated to the "safe" vectorized pairwise distance approach. Run 3's
  creative z-score solution significantly outperformed the target!
